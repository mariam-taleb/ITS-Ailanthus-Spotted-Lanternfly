# ITS2-SLFinfested-Ailanthus-PA-USA-2017

This study examined the fungal community structure on _Ailanthus altissima_ (AIL) infested with _Lycorma delicatula_, or Spotted lanternfly (SLF), an invasive phloem-feeder, on a residential property southeastern PA in 2017. Leaf surface swabs were field-collected over the course of 9 weeks, and observations were made of the development of sooty mold.  
Extraction, amplification, sequencing, and bioinformatic methods were adapted from the Earth Microbiome project (https://earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/its/). Sequencing was completed by the Genome Sciences Facility at the Penn State College of Medicine (Hershey, PA) for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform in 2019.

The QIIME pipeline was used for OTU picking and rarefaction.

Taxonomy was assigned to the most abundant OTUs, representing 90% of all sequences, by searching reference sequences against the NCBI GenBank BLAST, and manually curating results. 

FunGUILD was then used to assign guilds and functional groups where possible, and literature searches were conducted to add the the data set where neccessary and possible. 

The datasets were manipuled for ease of use with Microsoft Excel and data were analyzed with the R Statistical Software v. 4.0.3. (publish code).

Plots were edited for style using Adobe Illustrator CC 2020.
